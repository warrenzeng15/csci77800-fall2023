Open web is good for the general public, as it provides access to the public without any limitations, unlike walled garden style websites. 
With walled gardens, users cannot be sure of how their data is being stored, nor can they be sure of how secure their information is. In an open source/open management style system, users can check for flaws in the system and work together to improve things which could help both the security as well as the privacy of the users. It is generally better to have more "eyes" on something, as incorrect things can more easily be spotted and addressed. Take Wikipedia for example, where users can see incorrect information about a topic, and then work towards fixing it/updating it. In a walled garden like Facebook or Instagram, it's possible that the content being shown to the user is manipulated or specifically targeted towards that user to generate more subscriptions/revenue/etc. Users have no idea how the algorithim on these platforms work, and have no idea on how the companies are using their data. It would also be much harder to check if information found on these platforms are accurate -- they may be curated to lean towards certain beliefs, which could create echo chambers and prevent people from having more open minds.
